1. ONLINE NEWSPAPER.
Using HTML 5 only, create a prototype of an online newspaper.

Validate and verify the result on the browser as you proceed. Don’t mind about the visual aspect of the result (that will be taken care by using CSS).

Use the site http://www.lipsum.com/ if you need to generate example paragraphs.
Create separate sections for the header, menu and body of the newspaper. Use semantic tags (section, header, nav, …) for those sections.
The header should have a title (h1), a subtitle (h2) and a logo (img).
The menu should have links to each of the newspaper sections (sports, politics, …) organized using an unordered list (ul). These links can simply point to example URLs.
The newspaper body should have a section for each news item. Use the semantic tag article.
A news item should have a title (h3), an introduction (p) and an image (img). It should also have a footer containing the author name and date.
Don’t forget to validate the page when you’re done.
