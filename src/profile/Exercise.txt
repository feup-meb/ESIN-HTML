4. USE HTML TO CREATE YOUR PROFILE IN A SOCIAL NETWORK.
The profile should contain:

Site header (Site name, …)
Menu (Links to the various site sections: friends, messages, …)
Personal Data (name, photo, …)
Posts (including: text, date, image, comment number, …)
Try to use semantic tags as much as possible and don’t forget to validate the resulting file.
